You are summarizing a description of a landscape below into a calming, relaxing passage to accompany the image for a user. The goal is to help the listener de-stress and feel at ease while they look at the photo.

Make the tone clear, simple, and soothing. Focus on the natural beauty and peaceful qualities of the scene without unnecessary poetic flourishes or imaginative storytelling. Keep the passage concise â€” no more than 80 to 100 words.

DO NOT USE A HEADING IN YOUR SUMMARY!
